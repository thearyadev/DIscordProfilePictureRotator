# Discord Profile Picture Rotator

A tool to automatically change your discord profile picture. Note: Your discord account may get banned. Use at your own risk.

## Installation and Usage
Note: These instructions require the following tools installed: git, docker, docker compose
1. Get your discord token. There's plenty of resources online on how to do this. 
2. Find some profile pictures you would like to use.
3. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/thearyadev/DiscordProfilePictureRotator` This will clone the repository to your local environment. 
4. CD into the project directory. `cd DiscordProfilePictureRotator`
5. Open `./docker-compose.yaml` in a text editor.
   In this file, read all the comments (all lines starting with a `#`) and add all the missing information.
6. Run the command `docker compose up -d`

To stop the deployment, use the command `docker compose down` in the project directory. You can then edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file. To redeploy, run `docker compose up -d`

If you are having problems, stop the container with `docker compose down` then start it again with `docker compose up` (without the `-d` flag). This will run the container in interactive mode, where you can see the logs in your console.
